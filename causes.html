    <h2>Main Causes of Ocean Pollution</h2>

    <div class="image-block">
        <img src="image/causes1.jpg" alt="Plastic Pollution Image">
        <p>Plastic waste makes up most of the debris found in the ocean. Items like bags, bottles, and packaging break into microplastics that endanger marine life.</p>
        <button class="learn-more" onclick="toggleMore('cause1')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="cause1" class="hidden">Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the ocean. Sea turtles, fish, and seabirds often mistake plastics for food, leading to serious harm. While large debris like bottles and abandoned fishing gear are easily recognized, the more insidious threat comes from microplastics: tiny fragments less than five millimeters long. These microplastics are created in two ways: first, by the slow breakdown of larger plastic items in the ocean, and second, as primary pollutants like the microbeads found in some cosmetic products or the synthetic microfibers shed from washing clothes. Prevention must address both: reducing our reliance on single-use plastics to stop the source of large debris, and choosing ocean-friendly products free of microbeads to prevent the direct release of primary microplastics into the ecosystem.</p>

        <img src="image/causes3.jpg" alt="Ghost Fishing Image">
        <p>Abandoned fishing gear creates "ghost nets" that fatally trap marine life for decades, while general maritime traffic contributes to chemical and noise pollution that disrupts fragile ecosystems.</p>
        <button class="learn-more" onclick="toggleMore('cause2')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="cause3" class="hidden">A major, often unseen, cause of marine damage is pollution from general maritime activity, particularly the issue of "ghost fishing." This occurs when lost, abandoned, or discarded fishing gear (nets, traps, and lines) continues to drift freely in the ocean. Made of durable plastic, these nets can span miles, trapping and killing millions of marine animals—including protected species like sea turtles, whales, and dolphins—for decades. Additionally, large commercial vessels contribute to chronic pollution through noise pollution, which disrupts marine mammal communication and migration, and through accidental or intentional discharges of oil, fuel, and other hazardous waste, compounding the chemical burden on the ecosystem.</p>

    <div class="image-block">
        <img src="image/causes2.jpg" alt="Chemical Waste Image">
        <p>Factories and agriculture release chemicals that flow into rivers and eventually the sea. These pollutants disturb ecosystems and poison marine animals.</p>
        <button class="learn-more" onclick="toggleMore('cause2')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="cause2" class="hidden">Chemical runoff causes algal blooms, dead zones, and long-term damage to coral reefs and fish populations. Factories and large-scale agricultural operations are primary sources of dangerous pollutants that eventually flow into rivers and the sea, creating a destructive invisible tide. Industrial facilities often discharge untreated or improperly treated wastewater containing heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and toxic acids. Simultaneously, farms release massive quantities of nutrient runoff—primarily nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers. Once in the marine environment, these nutrients trigger explosive blooms of algae. When this algae dies, its decomposition consumes vast amounts of oxygen, leading to the formation of widespread, uninhabitable "dead zones" where marine life cannot survive. Furthermore, these chemicals and heavy metals bioaccumulate, moving up the food chain to poison fish, shellfish, and ultimately, pose serious health risks to humans who consume contaminated seafood.</p>

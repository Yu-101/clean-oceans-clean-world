    <h2>How We Can Help</h2>

    <div class="image-block">
        <img src="image/solutions1.jpg" alt="Beach Cleanup Image">
        <p>Community efforts like beach cleanups reduce waste entering the ocean and spread awareness.</p>
        <button class="learn-more" onclick="toggleMore('sol1')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="sol1" class="hidden">Community efforts, such as organized beach and waterway cleanups, serve a vital dual function that extends far beyond simply removing trash from the environment. On one hand, they provide immediate, tangible relief by directly intercepting harmful plastic debris and pollutants before they can break down into microplastics, ingestible by marine life, or become permanently embedded in the ecosystem. On the other, and perhaps more importantly, these events are powerful awareness engines. They bring the reality of the pollution crisis into clear focus for participants, fostering a sense of personal responsibility and motivating long-term behavioral change, such as reducing single-use plastics. Furthermore, the data collected during these cleanups—identifying the most common types and brands of waste—is critical. This information is then used to advocate for policy changes targeting the largest corporate polluters and improving local waste management systems.</p>

    <div class="image-block">
        <img src="image/solutions3.jpg" alt="Enforcement Image">
        <p>Long-term ocean health requires governments to establish and strictly enforce robust MPAs and international legislation to curb large-scale pollution.</p>
        <button class="learn-more" onclick="toggleMore('sol2')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="sol2" class="hidden">While individual action is vital, the long-term protection of the ocean requires robust national and international policy and legislation. Effective solutions involve governments creating and strictly enforcing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)—designated zones where fishing and other destructive human activities are severely restricted or banned entirely—to allow ecosystems to recover. Furthermore, global cooperation is essential to combat issues like Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing through international treaties and better surveillance technologies. Individuals can support this by advocating for legislative action, contacting elected officials to promote strong environmental protections, and supporting organizations that lobby for strict enforcement of existing regulations against large-scale polluters.</p>

    <div class="image-block">
        <img src="image/solutions2.jpg" alt="Recycling Image">
        <p>Proper recycling and reducing plastic usage help lower overall waste production.</p>
        <button class="learn-more" onclick="toggleMore('sol2')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="sol2" class="hidden">The proliferation of plastic pollution can be significantly slowed through small, yet profoundly impactful, individual actions: specifically, the consistent use of reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Single-use plastics—items designed to be used for mere minutes before being discarded—account for a massive percentage of the debris that floods our oceans. By choosing a reusable water bottle over disposable plastic, a cloth tote over a plastic shopping bag, or a lunch container over Styrofoam, individuals prevent countless items from ever entering the waste stream. This shift in habit demonstrates a crucial personal commitment to the environment and, when multiplied across a community, dramatically reduces demand for virgin plastic production. Ultimately, this collective commitment to the reusable revolution is a direct, daily challenge to the cycle of disposable waste that threatens marine life globally.</p>

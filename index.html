    <h2>Welcome to Clean Oceans, Clean Future</h2>
    <p>The ocean produces over half the oxygen we breathe and supports millions of marine species. Sadly, pollution and human actions are damaging it. Learn more about how we can protect our oceans.</p>

    <p id="moreHome" class="hidden">Despite increased global awareness and conservation efforts, the state of the world's oceans remains critical and is rapidly worsening. The most visible threat, plastic pollution, is reaching catastrophic levels, with an estimated 11 to 17 million metric tonnes of plastic entering the marine environment every single year—a rate projected to double or triple by 2040. This relentless influx of debris means that over 35% of global fish stocks are overfished, and destructive practices continue to undermine sustainable management efforts. Alarmingly, progress toward United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water) is currently rated as off-track. However, this crisis is not insurmountable. To reverse this trend, individuals can—and must—act now by drastically reducing reliance on single-use plastics, making informed choices to support sustainable seafood sources, and consistently advocating for policies that prioritize the long-term health of our blue planet over short-term gains.</p>

        <p>The ocean is arguably the most vital resource on our planet, performing functions critical for every living thing, regardless of location. Thanks to the photosynthetic activity of tiny organisms called phytoplankton, the sea produces at least 50% of the oxygen we breathe, effectively acting as the Earth's primary lung. Beyond this essential atmospheric role, the ocean drives global weather patterns, regulates climate by absorbing massive amounts of carbon dioxide, and supports over 80% of the world's biodiversity. However, this life-sustaining ecosystem is now facing an unprecedented crisis. Human activities have introduced destructive forces, from vast quantities of plastic debris to chemical runoff, which threaten to unravel the delicate marine balance. Understanding the severity of this pollution is the critical first step in protecting the immense biological and climatic services the ocean provides.</p>

        <p>The ocean plays a non-negotiable role as the world's primary climate regulator, absorbing vast quantities of heat and acting as the largest carbon sink on the planet. This critical function is performed by absorbing nearly a third of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions, which has helped mitigate global warming. However, this essential service comes at a profound cost: the increased carbon absorption leads directly to ocean acidification, making the water more corrosive and threatening the survival of calcifying organisms like corals, shellfish, and plankton—the very base of the marine food web. Protecting our oceans is therefore synonymous with protecting our climate, making marine conservation a central pillar in the fight for a stable, habitable future.</p>

        <p>Marine conservation is far more than just protecting scenic habitats; it is an act of self-preservation because the health of the ocean is inextricably linked to human survival. A thriving marine environment ensures global food security, as billions rely on seafood for protein, and it regulates climate by absorbing over 90% of the world's excess heat and approximately 30% of human-caused carbon emissions. We are all connected to this ecosystem, and the responsibility to protect it falls to every individual, regardless of how far they live from the coast. To start making a difference, we must reduce our plastic consumption, consistently choosing reusable items over single-use products, and consciously support sustainable seafood choices to prevent overfishing. By making these informed, daily decisions, we directly contribute to the resilience of our planet's life-support system.</p>
